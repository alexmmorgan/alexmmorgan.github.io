We investigated the formation and processes of a periglacial alluvial fan in the Northwest Territories, Canada, with implications for understanding similar features on Mars. We found that the fan was primarily built by a combination of debris flows and fluvial (water-driven) processes. By measuring sediment transport and runoff during a storm event, we estimated the rates at which sediment is moved and deposited. These findings are important for interpreting Martian alluvial fans, which are believed to have formed under similar periglacial conditions, potentially providing insights into Mars' ancient climate and water activity.
