Fan-shaped landforms on Mars are important clues about how water once flowed on the planetâ€™s surface. By studying where these features are found and what they look like, we can learn about Mars' past climate. We have created a new database of 1501 fan-shaped landforms on Mars, using images from a special camera. This study looks at two types of features: alluvial fans (formed by flowing water) and deltas (formed where rivers meet larger bodies of water), which we call scarp-fronted fan deposits (SFDs).
