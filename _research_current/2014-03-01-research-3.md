Fan-shaped landforms on Mars are geomorphic markers for past water flow and provide a record of the planet’s climate history. Using high resolution CTX data we conducted a global survey and mapped >1500 fans across Mars. Crater statistics indicate that 
Fans are located at lower elevations than the older valley networks, suggesting that Mars' climate changed, moving stable liquid water to new locations. Inside craters, alluvial fans are typically found on north, south, and east-facing slopes, likely due to snowmelt and rain influenced by nearby mountains.

For each fan, we collected data and compared them with similar features on Earth, finding that the formation processes were likely similar. While there’s no strong evidence of classic delta formation, the data support the idea that some SFDs may have formed in standing water, like deltas. Crater analysis suggests that many of these fans formed in more recent periods of Mars' history, showing that water activity continued for a long time.
