I'm a geologist interested in the how planetary surfaces change over time. Most of my work is focused on the early history of Mars. The Mars we see today is a cold and dry global desert, but it has landscapes that appear to be remarkably similar to the river valleys, alluvial fans, and deltas with which we are familiar on Earth. I use a combination of remote sensing data from orbital spacecraft, numerical modeling, and field work at analogue sites on Earth to better understand these landforms and the environment in which they formed.
