I am a planetary geomorphologist with a focus on how fluvial processes shape the landscapes of Earth, Mars, and Titan. My research primarily explores how Mars' surface evolved as its climate shifted from a wetter past to the cold, arid conditions we see today. While Earth's early geologic record has been largely obscured by tectonics, erosion, and volcanism, Mars preserves much of its ancient surface, offering a unique opportunity to study early planetary environments and draw parallels to early Earth conditions. Marsâ€™ fluvially altered landscapes also serve as a natural laboratory for testing landscape evolution models developed on Earth, underscoring the connections between planetary and terrestrial geology.

I use Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to analyze image and topographic data, complemented by numerical modeling. Additionally, I conduct fieldwork in locations that serve as geological or climatic analogues to the martian environment.

I am based in beautiful eastern Virginia. I am currently a staff scientist at the <a href="https://www.psi.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Planetary Science Institute (PSI)</a>, as well as a visiting research associate at the Smithsonian Institution. Previously I was at the National Air and Space Museum, the University of Virginia, NASA Ames Research Center, and the University of California Santa Cruz.

Despite my best efforts, this website is inevitably out of date, so I encourage you to also check out my <a href="https://www.psi.edu/staff/profile/alexander-morgan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PSI staff page</a>.
